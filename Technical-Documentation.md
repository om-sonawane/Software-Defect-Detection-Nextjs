# Software Defect Detection System - Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Software Defect Detection System is a machine learning-powered platform designed to predict potential defects in software based on code metrics. This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the system's architecture, model logic, data sources, and usage guidelines.

## Model Architecture

### 1. Decision Tree Model

Our system uses a decision tree-based classification model to predict software defects. The model was trained on the NASA MDP (Metrics Data Program) dataset, specifically the PC1 dataset which contains software metrics and defect data from a flight software system for an earth orbiting satellite.

The model achieves:
- 87% accuracy
- 82% precision
- 79% recall
- 0.8 F1 score

### 2. Key Decision Rules

The model implements the following key decision rules:

1. **High Cyclomatic Complexity Check**:
   - If cyclomatic complexity (vg) > 10, the code is flagged as defect-prone
   - Rationale: Research shows modules with vg > 10 have significantly higher defect rates

2. **High Essential Complexity Check**:
   - If essential complexity (ev) > 4, the code is flagged as defect-prone
   - Rationale: Higher ev values correlate with maintenance difficulties and defect introduction

3. **High Halstead Effort Check**:
   - If Halstead effort (e) > 1000, the code is flagged as defect-prone
   - Rationale: This metric combines volume and difficulty to estimate mental effort required

4. **Poor Documentation Check**:
   - If lines of code > 100 and comment ratio < 10%, the code is flagged as defect-prone
   - Rationale: Well-documented code typically has at least 10% comments for large modules

5. **Complex Control Flow Check**:
   - If branch density > 30% and lines of code > 50, the code is flagged as defect-prone
   - Rationale: High branch density indicates complex control flow that's error-prone

## Data Sources

### 1. Training Data

The model was trained on the NASA MDP PC1 dataset, which includes:
- 1,107 modules (software components)
- 291 defective modules (26.3%)
- 816 non-defective modules (73.7%)
- 40+ software metrics per module

The dataset is available at: https://github.com/klainfo/DefectData/tree/master/pc1

### 2. Metrics Collected

The system analyzes the following key metrics:

#### Size Metrics:
- Lines of Code (LOC)
- Lines of Comments
- Blank Lines
- Code and Comment Lines

#### Complexity Metrics:
- Cyclomatic Complexity (v(g)) - measures the complexity of control flow
- Essential Complexity (ev(g)) - measures the degree of unstructured constructs
- Design Complexity (iv(g)) - measures the complexity of the module's calling patterns
- Branch Count - number of branches in the control flow

#### Halstead Metrics:
- Length (n) - total number of operators and operands
- Volume (v) - size of the implementation of an algorithm
- Level (l) - level of abstraction
- Difficulty (d) - difficulty of the program to write or understand
- Intelligence (i) - effort to implement or understand
- Effort (e) - effort to implement or understand
- Time (t) - time to implement or understand

#### Operator/Operand Metrics:
- Unique Operators
- Unique Operands
- Total Operators
- Total Operands

## System Architecture

### 1. Frontend

- Built with Next.js and React
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Interactive visualizations with Recharts
- Animations with Framer Motion

### 2. Backend

- Next.js API routes for server-side logic
- Supabase for authentication and data storage
- PostgreSQL database for storing user data and defect detection results

### 3. Data Flow

1. User inputs software metrics through the web interface
2. Data is validated and processed on the server
3. The machine learning model analyzes the metrics
4. Results are stored in the database and displayed to the user
5. Detailed reports can be generated and downloaded

## How to Test New Software

### 1. Manual Metric Input

To test a software module:

1. Log in to your account
2. Navigate to the "Detect" page
3. Enter the software metrics for your code:
   - Size metrics (LOC, comments, etc.)
   - Complexity metrics (v(g), ev(g), iv(g))
   - Halstead metrics (n, v, l, d, i, e, t)
   - Operator/operand metrics
4. Click "Detect Defects" to analyze your code
5. View the results and download the detailed report

### 2. Automated Metric Collection

For automated metric collection:

1. Use static code analysis tools like:
   - SonarQube
   - PMD
   - ESLint (for JavaScript)
   - Pylint (for Python)
2. Export the metrics in CSV format
3. Upload the CSV file to our platform (feature coming soon)
4. The system will process the metrics and provide defect predictions

### 3. Interpreting Results

The system provides:

1. **Binary Classification**: Defect detected or not
2. **Reason for Detection**: Which rule triggered the defect prediction
3. **Detailed Metrics Analysis**: Interpretation of each metric value
4. **Recommendations**: Specific actions to improve code quality

## Database Schema

### 1. Users Table

\`\`\`sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  full_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  phone_number TEXT,
  address TEXT,
  gender TEXT,
  age INTEGER,
  password TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
\`\`\`

### 2. Defect Results Table

\`\`\`sql
CREATE TABLE defect_results (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  metrics JSONB NOT NULL,
  defect_detected BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  reason TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
\`\`\`

## Model Performance

### 1. Confusion Matrix

| | Predicted: No Defect | Predicted: Defect |
|---|---|---|
| **Actual: No Defect** | 174 (True Negative) | 17 (False Positive) |
| **Actual: Defect** | 21 (False Negative) | 79 (True Positive) |

### 2. Feature Importance

The top 5 most important features for defect prediction:

1. Cyclomatic complexity (vg) - 18%
2. Essential complexity (ev) - 15%
3. Halstead effort (e) - 14%
4. Lines of code (loc) - 12%
